# Mastering_Active_Directory

Step-by-Step Virtual Lab Setup (Windows Server 2025 + Windows 10) by Ryan Adams

I recently completed a hands-on Active Directory lab where I deployed Windows Server 2025 as a Domain Controller and connected Windows 10 client machines, all within a VirtualBox environment.

This lab provides a complete, step-by-step walkthrough for building a small-scale enterprise network in a secure virtual setup.

Lab Overview:

Installation of Windows Server 2025 and Windows 10

Configuration of DHCP, DNS, and NAT to enable full network communication

Promotion of the server to an Active Directory Domain Controller

Joining client machines to the domain

Validation of Group Policy, DHCP leases, and DNS name resolution

Configuration of Remote Access and NAT to provide internet access through the Domain Controller

Key Takeaways:

Designing and implementing a structured IP addressing scheme

Understanding the core concepts of Active Directory, domains, and authentication

Troubleshooting domain join failures and network connectivity problems

Gaining insight into how centralized authentication is managed in enterprise networks
